Bi(111)
=========================

The model for Bi(111) is made of :math:`s,\ p_x,\ p_y,\ p_z` orbitals, and actually uses the Slater-Koster parameters from a bulk description of Bi [Liu1995]_. This model also includes spin-orbit coupling, which is necessary to
produce the band inversion and so describe a 2d time-reversal topological insulator [Murakami2006]_. This material is described by a honeycomb lattice such that each sublattice is located at a different height :math:`z`. In principle the model includes
hoppings up to second neighbours, which are required to obtain the gap correctly, although the topological behaviour can be obtained also considering with first-neighbour hoppings only. Here we provide two configuration files, one 
with hoppings up to second-neighbours, and the other one with first-neighbour hoppings.

Do note that the model has more bands than those showed; however the relevant ones are the ones close to the Fermi energy.
