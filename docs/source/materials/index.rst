Materials 
=========================

We provide several configuration files corresponding to different Slater-Koster parametrizations of different materials, which can also be found in the ``/examples`` folder under the root of the repository.
These files can be used either for reference to define new systems, or as the starting point for further calculations. In all cases we show the resulting band structure as well as the corresponding configuration files, together
with the reference to the paper providing the SK parameters.
