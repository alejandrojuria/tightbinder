! Lines starting with ! are comments
! Lines with # denote argument types and must be present (removing one or wirting it wrogn will result in error)
! Blank spaces are irrelevant
! All numbers must be separated by either spaces, commas or semicolons
! BEWARE: Leaving a blank space at the beginning of a line will result in it being skipped

#System name
Minimal hBN model

#Dimensionality
2

#Bravais lattice
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis (vectors have to be in R^3).
! For 1D and 2D systems, the z (third) component must be zero (z should always be regarded as height component).
2.16506 1.25 0.0
2.16506 -1.25 0.0

#Species
! Number of atomic species
2

#Motif
! Each row corresponds to one vector (atom) of the basis; fourth number denotes atomic species.
! Numbering of species starts at 0.

1.443376 0 0 1

#Orbitals
! Always use cubic harmonic orbitals.
! Order is irrelevant.
! Possible orbitals are: s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2-y2, d3z2-r2
s
s

#Filling
! Specify number of electrons per chemical species; one line per species. 
! Fillings can be fractional, but total number of electons in unit cell must be an integer.
0.5
0.5

#Onsite energy
! One for each different orbital defined above.
! In case of having several atomic species multiple line must be specified, one for each element.

#SK amplitudes
! Order is fixed: Vsss, Vsps, Vpps, Vppp, Vsds, Vpds, Vpdp, Vdds, Vddp, Vddd (separated by spaces).
! Not present amplitudes can be omitted but ordering has te be respected always.
! The syntax for SK amplitudes allows to specify between which species are the hoppings, as well as
! which is the corresponding neighbour. 
! Syntax is: [species1, species2; n-th neighbour] V1 V2 ...
[0, 1] -2.3

#Spin
! Determine whether the model is spinless (spin polarized) or spinful.
! Must be either True (spinful) or False (spinless); if left blank it will default to False.
! NOTE: True or False must be capitalized.
False

#Spin-orbit coupling
! Note: Using a non-zero value will automatically produce a spinful model.
! Amplitude must be specified for all species; one line per species.

! --------------------- Simulation parameters ---------------------
#Mesh
! Number of kpoints in each direction. Syntax is Nx Ny Nz
! It suffices to provide the required number of points depending on the system's dimension
100 100

#High symmetry points
! Label of points which define the path to evalute the bands of the system
