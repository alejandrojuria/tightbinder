#System name
! Reference https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms14176
2-band GeS model

#Dimensionality
2

#Bravais lattice
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis (vectors have to be in R^3)
! For 1D and 2D systems, the z (third) component must be zero (z should always be regarded as height component)
2.265 1.815 0.0
2.265 -1.815 0.0

#Species
! Number of atomic species (isoelectronic at the moment)
2

#Motif
! Each row corresponds to one vector (atom) of the basis; fourth number denotes atomic species
! Species have to be either 0 or 1
0 0 0 0
0.52 0 0 1

#Filling
! Must provide filling per species, each filling can be fractional if the system is spinless.
! Sum of the total number of electrons in the system must be an integer.
0.5
0.5

#Orbitals
! Always use cubic harmonic orbitals
! Order is irrelevant
! Species have to be isoelectronic (same number of valence shell electrons)
! Possible orbitals are: s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2-y2, d3z2-r2
pz
pz

#Onsite energy
! One for each different orbital defined above
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
0.41
-0.41

#SK amplitudes
! Order is fixed: Vsss, Vsps, Vpps, Vppp, Vsds, Vpds, Vpdp, Vdds, Vddp, Vddd (separated by spaces)
! Not present amplitudes can be omitted but ordering has te be respected always
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element

#Spin
! Determine whether the model is spinless (spin polarized) or spinful
! Must be either True (spinful) or False (spinless); if left blank it will default to False
! NOTE: True or False must be capitalized
False
