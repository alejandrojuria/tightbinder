! --------------------- Config file formatting rules ---------------------
! Lines starting with ! are comments
! Lines with # denote argument types and must be present (removing one or wirting it wrogn will result in error)
! Blank spaces are irrelevant
! All numbers must be separated by either spaces, commas or semicolons
! Beware: Leaving a blank space at the beginning of a line will result in it being skipped

#System name
MoS2_Roldan

#Dimensionality
2

#Bravais lattice
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis (vectors have to be in R^3)
! For 1D and 2D systems, the z (third) component must be zero (z should always be regarded as height component)
3.16 0.0 0.0
1.58 2.73664 0.0

#Species
! Number of atomic species (isoelectronic at the moment)
2

#Motif
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis; fourth number denotes atomic species
! Species have to be either 1 or 2
0 0 0 0
0.0 1.8244 1.586 1
0.0 1.8244 -1.586 1

#Orbitals
! Always use cubic harmonic orbitals
! Possible orbitals are: s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2-y2, d3z2-r2
! NOTE: Order must be kept
dxy dyz dzx dx2-y2 d3z2-r2
px py pz

#Filling
6
4

#Onsite energy
! One for each different orbital defined above
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
-1.511 -0.050 -0.050 -1.511 -1.094
-3.559 -3.559 -6.886

#SK amplitudes
! Order is fixed: Vsss, Vsps, Vpps, Vppp, Vsds, Vpds, Vpdp, Vdds, Vddp, Vddd (separated by spaces)
! Not present amplitudes can be omitted but ordering has te be respected always
! Species must be specified using brackets. 
[0, 0; 1] -0.895 0.252 0.228
[0, 1; 1] 3.689 -1.241
[1, 1; 1] 1.225 -0.467

#Spin
! Determine whether the model is spinless (spin polarized) or spinful
! Must be either True (spinful) or False (spinless); if left blank it will default to False
! NOTE: True or False must be capitalized
True

#Spin-orbit coupling
! Note: Using a non-zero value will automatically produce a spinful model
0.1125
0.078

! --------------------- Simulation parameters ---------------------
#Radius
! If present, SlaterKoster model runs in "radius" mode, meaning that it will look
! for neighbours up to the given radius value
3.17

#Mesh
! Number of kpoints in each direction. Syntax is Nx Ny Nz
! It suffices to provide the required number of points depending on the system's dimension
200 200

#High symmetry points
! Label of points which make the path to evalute the bands of the system
