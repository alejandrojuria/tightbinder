! --------------------- Config file formatting rules ---------------------
! Lines starting with ! are comments
! Lines with # denote argument types and must be present (removing one or wirting it wrogn will result in error)
! Blank spaces are irrelevant
! All numbers must be separated by either spaces, commas or semicolons
! BEWARE: Leaving a blank space at the beginning of a line will result in it being skipped

#System name
Test square

#Dimensionality
2

#Bravais lattice   
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis (vectors have to be in R^3)
! For 1D and 2D systems, the z (third) component must be zero (z should always be regarded as height component)
1 0 0
0 1 0

#Species
! Number of atomic species (isoelectronic at the moment)
1

#Motif
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis; fourth number denotes atomic species
! Species have to be either 0 or 1
0 0 0 0

#Orbitals
! Always use cubic harmonic orbitals
! Order is irrelevant 
! Species have to be isoelectronic (same number of valence shell electrons)
! Possible orbitals are: s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2-y2, d3z2-r2
s

#Onsite energy
! One for each different orbital defined above
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
1

#SK amplitudes
! Order is fixed: Vsss, Vsps, Vpps, Vppp, Vsds, Vpds, Vpdp, Vdds, Vddp, Vddd (separated by spaces)
! Not present amplitudes can be omitted but ordering has te be respected always
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
