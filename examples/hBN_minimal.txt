#System name
Minimal hBN model

#Dimensionality
2

#Bravais lattice
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis (vectors have to be in R^3)
! For 1D and 2D systems, the z (third) component must be zero (z should always be regarded as height component)
2.16506 1.25 0.0
2.16506 -1.25 0.0

#Species
! Number of atomic species (isoelectronic at the moment)
2

#Motif
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis; fourth number denotes atomic species
! Species have to be either 0 or 1
0 0 0 0
1.443376 0 0 1

#Orbitals
! Always use cubic harmonic orbitals
! Order is irrelevant
! Species have to be isoelectronic (same number of valence shell electrons)
! Possible orbitals are: s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2-y2, d3z2-r2
s

#Onsite energy
! One for each different orbital defined above
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
3.625
-3.625

#SK amplitudes
! Order is fixed: Vsss, Vsps, Vpps, Vppp, Vsds, Vpds, Vpdp, Vdds, Vddp, Vddd (separated by spaces)
! Not present amplitudes can be omitted but ordering has te be respected always
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
-2.3
-2.3

#Spin
! Determine whether the model is spinless (spin polarized) or spinful
! Must be either True (spinful) or False (spinless); if left blank it will default to False
! NOTE: True or False must be capitalized
False

#Spin-orbit coupling
0
