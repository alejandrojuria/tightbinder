! --------------------- Config file formatting rules ---------------------
! Lines starting with ! are comments
! Lines with # denote argument types and must be present (removing one or wirting it wrogn will result in error)
! Blank spaces are irrelevant
! All numbers must be separated by either spaces, commas or semicolons
! Beware: Leaving a blank space at the beginning of a line will result in it being skipped
! -------------------------- Material parameters -------------------------
#System name
Sb(111) bilayer w/ SOC

#Dimensionality
2

#Bravais lattice
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis (vectors have to be in R^3)
! For 1D and 2D systems, the z (third) component must be zero (z should always be regarded as height component)
3.72391 2.15 0.0
3.72391 -2.15 0.0

#Species
! Number of atomic species (isoelectronic at the moment)
1

#Motif
! Each row corresponds to one vector of the basis; fourth number denotes atomic species
! Species have to be either 0 or 1
0 0 0 0
2.48261 0 -1.64 0

#Orbitals
! Always use cubic harmonic orbitals
! Species have to be isoelectronic (same number of valence shell electrons)
! Possible orbitals are: s, px, py, pz, dxy, dyz, dzx, dx2-y2, d3z2-r2
! NOTE: Order must be kept
s, px, py, pz

#Filling
! Specify number of electrons in the unit cell. Maximum number of electrons
! is given by natoms*orbitals_per_atom
5

#Onsite energy
! One for each different orbital defined above
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
-10.068 -0.926 -0.926 -0.926

#SK amplitudes
! Order is fixed: Vsss, Vsps, Vpps, Vppp, Vsds, Vpds, Vpdp, Vdds, Vddp, Vddd (separated by spaces)
! Not present amplitudes can be omitted but ordering has te be respected always
! In case of having two atomic species, two lines must be appended, one for each element
[0, 0; 1] -0.694 1.554 2.342 -0.582

#Spin
! Determine whether the model is spinless (spin polarized) or spinful
! Must be either True (spinful) or False (spinless); if left blank it will default to False
! NOTE: True or False must be capitalized
True

#Spin-orbit coupling
! Note: Using a non-zero value will automatically produce a spinful model
0.6

! --------------------- Simulation parameters ---------------------
#Mesh
! Number of kpoints in each direction. Syntax is Nx Ny Nz
! It suffices to provide the required number of points depending on the system's dimension
200 200

#High symmetry points
! Label of points which make the path to evalute the bands of the system
